🎯 Step-by-step mental flow (for you to say while teaching)

“We’re basically building a memory of what’s been opened.
Each time we open a new bracket, we add it to our stack.
Each time we close one, we check if it matches the last one we opened.
If they all open and close in perfect order — our stack ends empty, meaning the string is valid.”

🧠 Example walkthrough for viewers

Input:

s = "{[()]}"


Steps:

See { → open, push → stack = [{]

See [ → open, push → stack = [{, []

See ( → open, push → stack = [{, [, (]

See ) → close → pop (, matches ✅ → stack = [{, []

See ] → close → pop [, matches ✅ → stack = [{]

See } → close → pop {, matches ✅ → stack = []
✅ Stack empty → valid!

⚙️ Time and Space Complexity

Time Complexity → O(n):
Each character is processed once — pushed or popped once — no repeats.

Space Complexity → O(n):
In the worst case, if all are opening brackets like "(((((", the stack grows with the input length.

💡 Real-life analogy for your YouTube storytelling

“Think of coding like opening and closing containers.
If you open a lunch box, then open a smaller one inside it, you must close the smaller one first before closing the bigger one.
That’s the stack rule — last opened, first closed.
If you forget to close one properly, your lunch bag (or code) is a mess.”


🧮 Time and Space Complexity
Complexity Type	Explanation	Value
Time Complexity	-> We loop through the string once (O(n)), and each push/pop operation is O(1). So total time = O(n)	✅ O(n)
Space Complexity ->	In the worst case, if the string has all opening brackets (like "(([[{{"), we’ll store them all in the stack. That’s proportional to the input size.	✅ O(n)
⚖️ Comparison to the Earlier Solution

Both this version and the previous (more verbose) one have exactly the same time and space complexity: O(n).
The only difference is readability and style:

🧩 The first one was written in a very explicit, step-by-step beginner style (great for learning).

⚙️ This second one is more concise and production-ready, perfect for professionals who already understand stack concepts.

💡 Real-world Example for Beginners

Imagine you’re designing HTML or JSX syntax validation in a code editor like VS Code or React’s compiler.
When you open a tag like <div>, you must also close it with </div>.
If someone forgets to close it or closes in the wrong order, it should throw an error — and this exact logic (using a stack) helps detect that.

🧰 Professional applications:

Compilers use this kind of logic to check code syntax.

Markdown or XML parsers validate nested tags.

Template engines like Handlebars or EJS use this same principle under the hood.

Even bracket matchers in editors (when you highlight one, the matching one blinks) — use the same stack-based validation.
