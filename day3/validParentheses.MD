🎯 Step-by-step mental flow (for you to say while teaching)

“We’re basically building a memory of what’s been opened.
Each time we open a new bracket, we add it to our stack.
Each time we close one, we check if it matches the last one we opened.
If they all open and close in perfect order — our stack ends empty, meaning the string is valid.”

🧠 Example walkthrough for viewers

Input:

s = "{[()]}"


Steps:

See { → open, push → stack = [{]

See [ → open, push → stack = [{, []

See ( → open, push → stack = [{, [, (]

See ) → close → pop (, matches ✅ → stack = [{, []

See ] → close → pop [, matches ✅ → stack = [{]

See } → close → pop {, matches ✅ → stack = []
✅ Stack empty → valid!

⚙️ Time and Space Complexity

Time Complexity → O(n):
Each character is processed once — pushed or popped once — no repeats.

Space Complexity → O(n):
In the worst case, if all are opening brackets like "(((((", the stack grows with the input length.

💡 Real-life analogy for your YouTube storytelling

“Think of coding like opening and closing containers.
If you open a lunch box, then open a smaller one inside it, you must close the smaller one first before closing the bigger one.
That’s the stack rule — last opened, first closed.
If you forget to close one properly, your lunch bag (or code) is a mess.”
