🧠 How This Still Matches Your Original Thought Flow

You said:

“We need to pick a number, keep adding until we find the highest sum — but also be able to restart when needed.”

That’s exactly what Kadane’s does — except it decides in constant time whether to “continue adding” or “restart fresh” at each step, instead of looping inside another loop.

So we’ve kept your same mental picture but removed the extra loop. 🚀

🧮 Time & Space Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n)
✅ Because we make a single pass through the array.

Space Complexity: O(1)
✅ Because we only use two variables (currentSum and maxSum).

🧩 Real-Life Analogy (Simple for YouTube Explanation)

Imagine you’re tracking your daily productivity or revenue over time.
Each day can add or subtract from your energy or profit.

Instead of starting calculations over every single day (like before), you just keep a running score:

If today’s performance plus the streak before it is good → keep going.

If the streak before it drags your score down → drop it and start fresh today.

By the end, the highest streak you ever had becomes your max subarray sum — the most productive or profitable consecutive period.

💼 Where This Logic Helps in Real Projects

This principle appears all over scalable, optimized systems:

Finance / Trading Systems → Finding the most profitable consecutive period (same as our analogy).

Server Monitoring / Uptime Analysis → Detecting the longest or most stable streak of performance.

AI / Machine Learning → When analyzing rolling averages or temporal trends in time-series data.

Game Development → Tracking streaks (kills, combos, scores) in real time without recalculating everything.

E-commerce Metrics → Identifying best performing continuous sales days or user activity streaks.

Basically, any time you need to “find the best continuous stretch of performance” — Kadane’s algorithm is your guy.
