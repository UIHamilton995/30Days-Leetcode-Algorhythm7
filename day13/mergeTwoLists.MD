🧠 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you’re sorting two stacks of customer invoices by date — both stacks are already sorted individually.
You want to create one unified list of invoices sorted by date.

So you:

Look at the top of each stack.

Whichever invoice has the earlier date, you pull it out and put it into a new stack.

Repeat until both stacks are empty.

That’s exactly what this algorithm does — it merges two already-sorted sequences into one larger sorted sequence.

💼 Real-World Developer Applications

This logic appears all over real systems, especially where data merging happens:

Merge step in Merge Sort — one of the core sorting algorithms.

Merging database query results that are pre-sorted (e.g., combining paginated API data).

Combining ordered event streams (like merging logs from multiple servers).

Version control (e.g., Git) — merging sorted commits by timestamp.

Streaming systems → merging two sorted event streams in time order.

Server log aggregation → merging logs sorted by timestamp from multiple microservices.

The beauty is: you don’t re-sort — you just merge already sorted lists efficiently.

Linked list-based data structures in memory-efficient systems (used in OS-level queueing or kernel memory management).


⚙️ Time and Space Complexity 
Complexity	            Explanation	                                                     Value
Time Complexity	        We visit each node once. Regardless of which list it comes from, every comparison moves one pointer forward.	                                                             O(n + m)
Space Complexity	      We’re not creating new nodes — just rearranging pointers. Only a few extra variables (dummy, current) are used.	                                                    O(1)

✅ Therefore:
It’s linear time and constant space — extremely efficient.
