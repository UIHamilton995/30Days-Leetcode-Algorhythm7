For the first solution,

⏱ Time Complexity

O(n) — we loop once through the prices.

🧠 Space Complexity

O(1) — we only store a few variables (minPrice, maxProfit, currentProfit).

For the Second solution,


⚙️ Time and Space Complexity
Type	Complexity	Explanation
Time	O(n)	We only loop through the list once — every price is checked exactly one time.
Space	O(1)	We use only two variables (minValue and profit) no matter how large the price list gets.

This is the gold standard for performance: single pass, constant memory — exactly what top-tier interviewers and engineers look for. 🚀

🧠 Real-Life Analogy (for Beginners)

Imagine you’re buying and selling phones in a market over several days:

You track the daily prices of iPhones.

You want to know the maximum profit you could make if you bought on one day and sold on another later day.

You can’t go back in time, so you can only sell after you’ve bought.

Your logic becomes:

“I’ll always remember the cheapest price I’ve seen so far — because that’s my best buy option.
Each day, I’ll check how much I’d earn if I sold today.
If it’s higher than my previous best, that’s my new record profit.”

That’s exactly what this algorithm does.

💼 Professional or Development Scenarios

This kind of logic shows up far beyond stock trading apps, Boss. It’s a classic “track the minimum, maximize the delta” pattern.
Here are some real-world dev use cases where this same thinking powers scalable systems:

E-commerce analytics
→ Track lowest cost of goods vs current sale price to calculate peak margins.
Example: “At what point in time did our profit per unit peak for this product?”

Server uptime monitoring
→ Measure the lowest latency (best performance) and the largest improvement gap.
Example: “Between which times did our server response improve the most?”

Machine learning feature engineering
→ Capture max increases or drops in sensor readings or user behavior data over time.
Example: “The largest jump in temperature between consecutive readings.”

Crypto or Forex bots
→ Continuously find the best time window to buy low and sell high in a moving market, in real-time.

Budget optimization dashboards
→ Track the lowest spending day vs. highest revenue day after it to show peak performance gaps.

⚡ Why This Algorithm Is a Beast

Single pass: It doesn’t waste time checking combinations.

Constant memory: Doesn’t grow with input size.

Always up-to-date: Keeps recalculating best buy and best profit on the fly.

Scalable: Can handle millions of price points smoothly in real-time streams.

That’s why this pattern sits right beside twoSum and sliding window as one of the most fundamental data pattern trackers in algorithmic logic, Boss.

Let’s make this sound exactly like you’re teaching a beginner audience live, step-by-step, breaking the logic in human English while still flexing that pro-engineer clarity.

Here’s your teaching version, ready for your LeetCode/YouTube breakdown 👇

🎬 SCRIPT: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock — Explained Like You’re Five (but Ambitious)
// 🔥 Hey guys, welcome back to HamiltonCode!
// Today, we’re solving one of the most famous interview questions on LeetCode:
// 🧩 The Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock.

// The idea is simple: 
// We're given a list of prices — where prices[i] represents the stock price on day i.
// We want to find the *maximum profit* we can get 
// if we buy on one day and sell on another day *after* that.

// For example, if prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4],
// the best time to buy is at 1 (day 2), and the best time to sell is at 6 (day 5).
// That gives us a profit of 6 - 1 = 5.

// Now let’s break this problem down, line by line 👇

var maxProfit = function (prices) {
    // 🧠 Step 1: Let's start by assuming that the first day's price is our minimum buy price.
    // We’ll keep checking if there’s a cheaper day to buy as we go.
    let minValue = prices[0];

    // 💰 Step 2: Initialize our profit to 0 — 
    // meaning we haven't made any money yet, just starting out.
    let profit = 0;

    // 🚀 Step 3: Now we loop through the rest of the prices (starting from day 1)
    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {

        // 🕵️ Step 3a: Each day, we check if today's price is cheaper than our current minimum.
        // If it is, we update our minValue.
        // Because if we find a cheaper stock, we want to "buy" there instead.
        minValue = Math.min(prices[i], minValue);

        // 💹 Step 3b: Then we calculate how much profit we'd make
        // if we bought at the cheapest price so far (minValue)
        // and sold today at prices[i].
        let todayProfit = prices[i] - minValue;

        // 🧮 Step 3c: If that profit is greater than any profit we’ve seen so far,
        // we update our profit.
        // That means this is now our new best buy-sell pair.
        profit = Math.max(todayProfit, profit);
    }

    // 🎯 Step 4: Once we’ve gone through all prices,
    // we return the highest profit we found.
    // If prices only dropped every day, profit will stay at 0.
    return profit;
};

// ✅ Example Run
// prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
// Output → 5  (Buy at 1, sell at 6)

🧩 Let’s break that down with a visual story

Imagine you’re in the phone market in Lagos or Toronto.
You want to buy an iPhone cheap and sell it later when the price goes up.

On Day 1, price = ₦700k → you think “hmm... not bad.”

On Day 2, price = ₦100k → 🔥 now that’s a steal! You buy it.

On Day 3, price = ₦500k → if you sell now, profit = ₦400k.

On Day 5, price = ₦600k → profit = ₦500k.

Then prices drop again later.

You realize that the best time to buy was Day 2 and the best time to sell was Day 5.
That’s exactly what our code figures out — automatically, in one smooth loop.

⚙️ Time & Space Complexity (Keep It Simple)

Time Complexity → O(n)
Because we only loop through the price list once.
One look, one scan — no nested loops, no wasted checks.

Space Complexity → O(1)
We’re only storing two small variables:

minValue for the lowest price we’ve seen, and

profit for the biggest profit we’ve seen.

That’s constant space — the memory used doesn’t grow even if you have a million prices.

This makes it super fast and lightweight. It’s literally the “Tesla of stock algorithms” — efficient, quiet, and powerful ⚡

💡 Real-Life Applications of This Logic

This pattern of “track the lowest value seen so far, then find the biggest difference after it”
shows up everywhere in real-world software engineering.

Here are some pro-level use cases 👇

📈 Trading Bots / Crypto Dashboards
Continuously scan price feeds to decide the best buy/sell moments in real time.

💰 E-commerce Analytics
Track your product cost prices over time and find the maximum margin window —
“When was the cheapest supply vs the highest selling period?”

🧠 AI / Data Science Models
Detect sudden spikes or drops in metrics — for example, “biggest increase in temperature,” or “sharpest drop in latency.”

🖥️ Performance Monitoring Tools
Measure “best improvement” — like finding when your app’s speed jumped the most between versions.

🏗️ Scalable Systems / Optimization
This logic helps design algorithms that stream data efficiently — no storing all values, just comparing on the fly, saving memory and time.

🧠 Why This Logic Is Genius

It looks short and simple — but what’s really happening here is real-time optimization.
For each new data point (price), the algorithm is learning from the past and improving its best decision — without ever starting over.

That’s the same principle behind streaming analytics, machine learning pipelines, and smart monitoring dashboards in big systems.

You’re not just solving a coding challenge here —
you’re mastering a fundamental pattern for scalable thinking 🧩
