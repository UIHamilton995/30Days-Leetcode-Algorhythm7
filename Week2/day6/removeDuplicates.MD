🧠 Time Complexity — O(n)

Let’s break that down like you would on your stream:

We loop through the array once, from the second element to the end.

Inside the loop, all operations (!==, assignment, increment) are O(1) constant time.

So total cost grows linearly with the number of elements → O(n).

🧩 Example in numbers:
If you have 10 stock prices → ~10 steps.
If you have 1 million sorted IDs → ~1 million steps.
That’s it — no nested comparisons, no duplicates of effort.

💾 Space Complexity — O(1)

Why?

We didn’t create a new array or object (no Set, no copy).

We reused the same memory (mutating nums directly).

Only two extra variables read and write — constant space, not dependent on input size.

That’s what makes it scalable — even if nums has 10 million elements, memory use barely changes.

🏪 Real-Life Analogy — “Warehouse with Sorted Boxes”

Imagine you manage a warehouse with sorted boxes labeled by serial number:

[100, 100, 101, 101, 101, 102, 103, 103, 104]


You don’t have space to open a second warehouse, so you can’t create a copy.

So you walk through the line once:

Keep a pointer to where your next unique box should be placed.

If the current box label differs from the last unique one, shift it forward.

By the end, all unique labels are neatly packed at the front.

You didn’t buy new shelves (O(1) space), and you walked the line once (O(n) time).
Efficient, clean, and organized — that’s what this algorithm does.

💻 Professional / Real-World Applications
1. Database or API deduplication

When data from a backend API is already sorted (e.g. by ID, date, timestamp), this logic helps clean it in-place before sending it to the frontend or storing it.

Example: Remove duplicate user IDs or transaction IDs before displaying analytics.

Advantage: You don’t need extra arrays or DB memory — perfect for large-scale systems.

2. Compression pipelines

When compressing data streams or logs sorted by timestamp, this helps reduce redundancy directly inside the data buffer without reallocation — ideal for embedded systems or IoT.

3. Search engine indexing

When the index builder gets sorted lists of document IDs (sorted merge outputs), this in-place deduplication helps remove duplicate IDs efficiently, saving both CPU and RAM — huge at scale.

4. Financial software / trading apps

When stock data arrives sorted by time but contains duplicate ticks (same price repeated), this helps clean the dataset before analysis.
Faster data, cleaner insights.

🚀 Why It’s a Scalable Pattern

This pattern (two-pointer technique) generalizes into dozens of other real-world optimizations:

Merge sorted lists

Sliding window for substring problems

Partitioning data for parallel processing

Filtering sensor readings or API results in place

Because it avoids extra space, it scales beautifully on memory-limited environments (mobile, embedded, streaming backends).

🧩 TL;DR Summary for Your YouTube Script

“We walk through a sorted array once.
We don’t create any new arrays.
We just use two pointers — one to read, one to write — and we clean duplicates as we go.
Time? O(n). Space? O(1).
It’s not just smart — it’s scalable.
This logic runs everywhere from databases to financial data systems to web servers that process millions of rows efficiently.”


FOR SECOND SOLUTION 
⚙️ Time Complexity — O(n)

Both the earlier version (with for) and this one (with while) share the same time complexity:

The right pointer scans through the array exactly once, from start to end.

Each comparison or assignment happens in constant time (O(1)).
✅ Total time cost grows linearly with the number of elements → O(n).

Why not faster?
Because every element must be checked at least once to confirm if it’s a duplicate or not — no way around that.

💾 Space Complexity — O(1)

We don’t create any extra data structures or arrays.
Just a few variables: left, right.
✅ Memory usage stays constant regardless of input size → O(1).

⚖️ Comparison to the Earlier for Loop Version
Feature	              for loop version	            while loop version
Structure	compact,    simple iteration	            more explicit control over pointers
Readability	          beginner-friendly	            shows pointer logic clearly
Time Complexity	      O(n)	                        O(n)
Space Complexity	    O(1)	                        O(1)
Behavior	            identical results	            identical results

✅ So yes — they both have exactly the same complexity, just different expressions of the same logic.
