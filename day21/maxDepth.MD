🧍🏽‍♂️ Real-life Analogy

Think of this like an organizational chart:

The CEO is level 1.

Their direct managers are level 2.

Each manager’s employees are level 3.

Your job is to find the longest reporting chain in the company — i.e., the deepest branch in the org chart.

That’s exactly what the function maxDepth(root) does.

🧠 Core Idea (Recursion Thinking)

When you look at a binary tree, each node can be thought of as a mini tree on its own.
So to find the max depth of the entire tree, we just need to:

Find the max depth of the left subtree.

Find the max depth of the right subtree.

Take the larger of the two, and add 1 (for the current node).

In plain English:

“The depth of a tree is 1 + the deeper of its two branches.”


⚙️ Time & Space Complexity
Approach	         Time	                            Space	            Real-world Analogy
Recursive (DFS)	   O(n) – visits every node once	  O(h) – where h is height of tree (stack space)	Like exploring one full branch to the end, then backtracking
Iterative (BFS)	   O(n)	                            O(n) – queue can hold a full level	Like exploring level by level in a company hierarchy
💼 Real-world Dev Application

In real development, recursion like this comes up when:

Traversing JSON trees (e.g., nested menus or folder structures)

Rendering React component trees (each component can contain children)

Analyzing nested data (like categories with subcategories)

For example, in a file explorer app:

maxDepth() could represent the deepest folder level inside a project directory.

🧠 TL;DR Summary
Concept	                Explanation
Base case	              Empty tree = depth 0
Recursive case	        1 + deeper of left/right branches
Math insight	          depth = 1 + Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth)
Big Idea	              Every node contributes 1 to the path’s length
Analogy	                Deepest chain of command in a company
