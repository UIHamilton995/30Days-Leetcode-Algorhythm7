💡 Real-Life Analogy 1

Imagine you’re scanning a sorted product price list, trying to find two items that exactly use up your budget.

You start by pairing the cheapest item (left pointer) and the most expensive item (right pointer).

If the total price is too high, drop the expensive one (move right pointer down).

If it’s too low, pick a pricier one (move left pointer up).

Keep balancing until the sum equals your target budget.

That’s exactly what the algorithm does — it “balances the budget.”

⚙️ Time and Space Complexity
Operation	                            Complexity
Pointer scan (single pass)	          O(n)
Space usage	                          O(1) (no extra data structures)

This beats the brute-force O(n²) approach hands down, and it’s way cleaner.

💼 Real-World Developer Uses

💳 Expense matching systems – find two transactions that sum to a specific total.

🛒 E-commerce pricing algorithms – find two product prices that fit within a customer’s credit limit.

💾 Optimization problems – balancing resource pairs to meet a constraint.

🧠 Data analytics – finding complementary values in sorted datasets (e.g., min/max balance sheets).

⚙️ Real-Life Analogy 2

Imagine you’re building a finance app with me, Boss Hamilton 💼 —
and you want to find two transactions that sum up to a specific budget (say ₦100,000).

You could:

Store each transaction amount (like numbers[i]) and its position (like its ID) in a lookup system (your Map).

Then, for every new transaction, instantly check if there’s a “matching” one that makes up ₦100,000 when added together.

That’s exactly what this algorithm does: quick lookups instead of rescanning the whole database.

🖥️ Real-World Dev Application

In software systems, this Map-based approach models caching and lookup:

When we do database joins, price matching, or inventory reconciliation,
we often use hash-like lookups for constant-time retrieval.

Example: matching customer payments with invoices — you store invoices in a map,
then scan payments and instantly find matches.
