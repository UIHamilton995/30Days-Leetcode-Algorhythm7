⚙️ Time & Space Complexity        
Metric	            Explanation	                                                       Value
Time Complexity	    Building count map: O(n), Checking nums2: O(m) → total O(n + m)	   ✅ More efficient
Space Complexity	  We use an object (count) to store frequencies of nums1.	           O(n)

🧩 Real-Life Development Situations
Scenario	                            Relevance to Algorithm
🛒 E-commerce cart reconciliation	    Checking which products exist in both user’s cart and available inventory, including how many units still available.
📊 Data merging / analytics	          Finding common user IDs that appear in two large datasets (e.g., active vs. inactive user lists).
🎟️ Event registrations	               Determining which users registered for both a free trial event and a paid workshop.
📱 Backend filtering	                When syncing data between client and server, you often need to find intersection of updated records and cached data.

⚔️ Comparative Summary
Feature   	        Nested Loop Version	                                Map (for-of) Version
Logic Simplicity	  Easier to visualize for beginners (like comparing two lists manually).	Slightly abstract (involves counting logic).
Performance	        Slower (O(n × m)) — works fine for small arrays.	  Faster (O(n + m)) — ideal for large datasets or production APIs.
Memory Usage	      Very light (no extra data structures).	            Uses extra space for count map (O(n)).
Life Use Case	      Quick prototype, debugging, learning recursion or nested loops.	Production-grade code for backend filters or database comparisons.
Readability	        Beginner friendly, more intuitive.	                Professional and scalable, used in real systems.


🎬 Outro Summary for Your YouTube Explanation

“So, to wrap this up — both solutions give the same result,
but they’re designed for different stages of your developer journey.

The nested loop version is like checking through two lists manually — simple but slower.

The HashMap version is like keeping a record book of what you already have — faster and smarter for bigger problems.

In real projects, you’ll often use the second one because efficiency matters when working with thousands of data entries.

But for understanding the fundamentals, always start with the first. That’s how you build intuition before optimization.” 🚀
