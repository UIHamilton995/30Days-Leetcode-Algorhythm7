💡 Real-Life Analogy 1

Imagine you and I are comparing two sets of scrabble tiles.

You dump your tiles on the table: "listen"

I dump mine: "silent"

If we sort them alphabetically, both piles look like:
['e', 'i', 'l', 'n', 's', 't']

Since every tile matches one-to-one, we know both words are made of the same letters — they’re anagrams.

⚙️ Time and Space Complexity
Operation                         	  Cost
Sorting both strings	                O(n log n)
Comparing both	                      O(n)
Total Time Complexity	                O(n log n)
Space Complexity (for new arrays)	    O(n)

Checking for anagrams might sound trivial, but it’s actually used in:

Data cleaning pipelines – detecting similar identifiers (e.g., “rescue_team” vs “team_rescue”).

Natural language processing (NLP) – word pattern recognition.

Cybersecurity – detecting obfuscated code (e.g., rearranged variable names).

🧠 Real-Life Analogy 2

Imagine two chefs making “word salads.”
Each chef grabs a basket and fills it with letter ingredients.

Chef S (string s) fills a basket with each letter and notes down how many of each he used (map).

Chef T (string t) comes along and starts removing those same ingredients one by one.

If Chef T manages to remove exactly what Chef S added — no more, no less — the baskets match perfectly.
👉 That’s an anagram.

But if Chef T ever tries to remove an ingredient that isn’t there (e.g., extra 'x' or missing 'l'), the system immediately yells ❌ “not an anagram!”

⚙️ Time and Space Complexity
Operation	Complexity
First loop over s	O(n)
Second loop over t	O(n)
Total Time Complexity	O(n)
Space Complexity	O(1) (limited by alphabet size, usually 26 lowercase letters)

This beats the sorting approach (which is O(n log n)) in both speed and memory efficiency.

💼 Real Dev Project Applications

🧾 Data integrity checks: e.g., ensuring two identifiers are rearranged versions of each other (like obfuscated API keys).

🔤 NLP preprocessing: cleaning word lists to find similar token structures.

🔒 Cybersecurity and hashing: detecting shuffled or disguised text patterns in scripts.

🕵️ Plagiarism or text similarity systems: matching rearranged keywords or sentences.
