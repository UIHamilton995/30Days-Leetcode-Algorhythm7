🧠 Real-Life Analogy 1

Think of this like reversing a phone number written on paper:

You can’t reverse a numerical value (like 123) directly — you first need to write it down as a string of digits ("123").

Then you flip the order ("321"), and finally, you read it back as a number (321).

🧰 Practical Developer Use Case

This kind of manipulation appears in:

Parsing IDs or codes that have to be reversed for pattern matching or encoding.

Data transformations when you receive numeric strings in APIs that must be flipped or formatted before use.

⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
Operation	    Complexity	      Reason
Time	        O(n)	            We iterate over each character once during split → reverse → join
Space	        O(n)	            We store an array of characters temporarily during the process


🧠 Step-by-Step Breakdown 2 (For Beginners)

Let’s say x = 1234.

Step	  x (original)	lastDigit = x % 10	rev (accumulated)	      x (next)
1	      1234	        4	                  0 * 10 + 4 = 4	        123
2	      123	          3	                  4 * 10 + 3 = 43	        12
3	      12	          2	                  43 * 10 + 2 = 432	      1
4	      1	            1	                  432 * 10 + 1 = 4321	    0

✅ Once x becomes 0, we have rev = 4321.

💡 Analogy: The Cash Register Shift

Imagine you’re counting cash into a register:

You take the last digit of the number (the unit digit) — just like taking the last coin from a pile.

You drop it into a new stack (rev), which multiplies by 10 each time to shift previous digits left.

When you’ve taken all coins (digits), you’ve reversed the order of your pile.

⚙️ Why This Is Better (in Performance Terms)
Method	          Approach	                                        Time	Space
String Reversal	  Convert number → string → reverse → parseInt	    O(n)	O(n)
Math Reversal	    Extract digits using % and /	                    O(n)	O(1)

💡 The math method uses constant space, because it never stores an entire string or array — just a few variables.
That’s why interviewers and low-level systems (like embedded or financial engines) prefer this approach.

🧰 Real Developer Applications

This technique comes in handy when you:

Work on systems without high-level string utilities (e.g., C, embedded JS runtimes, or IoT devices).

Need to handle huge numeric data streams efficiently (e.g., reversing IDs, version codes, or hash checks).

Build custom serialization or encoding systems (where you manipulate digits bit-by-bit).

🧩 Bonus: Handling Negative Numbers

We multiply the final reversed number by its stored sign (+1 or -1).
So -123 → sign = -1, reversed digits = 321, result = -321.
