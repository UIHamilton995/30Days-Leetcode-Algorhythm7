🧩 Real-Life Development Situations

Scenario	                  Analogy
🧾 Data reconciliation	    You have a list of transactions, each appearing twice (once from debit, once from credit) — find the one that didn’t balance out.
📦 Inventory system	        Identifying an item in a stock list that was scanned only once due to barcode error.
🧍 User tracking	          Finding the unique user session that didn’t log out properly in server logs.

⚙️ Time & Space Comparison
Version	                        Time	    Space	        Remarks
Your (fixed) nested loop	      O(n²)	    O(1)	        Simple but slow for large arrays
HashMap count	                  O(n)	    O(n)	        Fast and readable
XOR	                            O(n)	    O(1)	        Fastest and most elegant


💬 YouTube Teaching Cue (Script Idea)

“Now, imagine you have a list of items,
and every item appears twice — except one special one that doesn’t have a twin.

We could check every pair one by one (slow but easy),
or we could use a smarter approach —
build a record of who showed up how many times.

But in the real world, computers don’t even need a record —
they can use a simple XOR trick that cancels out all pairs automatically!
That’s the beauty of binary logic.” ⚡
